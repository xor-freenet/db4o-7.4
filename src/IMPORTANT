The directory names "db4ojdk1.2" and "db4ojdk5" might sound like these
are versions of db4o for outdated Java versions and thus could be
removed.

This is NOT the case:
Instead these directories contain additional optimizations which are
shipped on top of the main db4o classes.
The version in their name indicates the minimal Java version required
for them.

Source of this information: See the Ant build.xml in the root directory.
